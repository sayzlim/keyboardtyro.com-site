			<h2>General Questions</h2>

			<section class="question-container">
				<div class="flow">
					<h3>What is Keyboard Maestro?</h3>

					<p><a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" title="Keyboard Maestro">Keyboard Maestro</a> is an application that lets you automate tasks that you usually do with macOS. It can virtually do everything that you've been doing with a user-friendly interface.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flow">
					<h3>Do I need to know how to code to take advantage of Keyboard Maestro?</h3>

					<p>Keyboard Maestro offers a wide range of built-in actions that make it easy for any macOS user to create macros that save time. While coding skills provide additional flexibility for data processing, they are not necessary to use the software effectively.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flow">
					<h3>Do I need to buy Keyboard Maestro to use these macros?</h3>
					<p>Yes, you must own Keyboard Maestro if you wish to use these macros. I have saved more than 500 hours with macros, and I recommend that you check it out even if you don't plan to buy it yet.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="flow">
					<h3>Do I need a subscription to use the ChatGPT Clarity macro?</h3>
					<p>You don't need a subscription to use this macro; however, you must sign up for OpenAI and obtain your own API key. Be sure to add credit to your account for the API key to function. This approach is cost-effective because you only pay for each request made.</p>
